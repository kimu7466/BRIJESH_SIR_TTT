"""
In Python, a while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is evaluated as true. The structure of a while loop is as follows:

syntax :
while (condition):
    # code of block 
"""

# while (True):
#     print("python")

# NAME = "brijesh"
# start = 0
# while (start < len(NAME)):
#     print(NAME[start])
#     start += 1
